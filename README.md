## Description
<p align="justify">
Designing an effective safety application for women is imperative to address and prosecute crimes against them, especially given the increasing concerns about harassment in workplace and public transport worldwide. The proposed system focuses on enhancing women’s security by utilizing GPS tracking to pinpoint the victim’s exact location. This not only reduces the risk for the user but also aids relatives or authorities in precisely identifying the location of the person in distress. Mauli – Women’s Safety Application facilitates quick access to national hotline numbers such as Women in Distress, Domestic Abuse, Police, Student/Child helpline, and Ambulance, enabling users to dial them promptly without the hassle of searching or typing. Additionally, the system incorporates an audio track featuring a police siren, referred to as the "Siren" feature, acting as a deterrent and potentially delaying any imminent danger for the victim. the main motto of this app is to prevent women in strange situations. While exploring various technologies, including embedded systems, the Internet of Things, wearable devices like jackets and bands, it's crucial to recognize that each approach has its own set of limitations.
